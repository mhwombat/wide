**New in release 1.4: support for quick searches of documentation sites such as Hoogle and Hayoo**

You might be interested in **wIDE**, the **Wombat Integrated Development Environment**, if:

1. You want an ultra-lightweight IDE.

2. You use an Xwindow manager that automatically lays out your applications. (I use Xmonad, but you should be able to use wIDE with any Xwindow manager.)

3. You want to edit files using the editor and terminal of your choice.

4. You don't need an IDE to find function, variable and class definitions for you. (I might add ctags support later, but for now, wIDE is probably best suited for one-person projects.)

5. You're familiar with Unix shell scripts. (wIDE is a small shell script, so it's easy to customise and extend.)

The current version is **[v1.5](http://code.google.com/p/wide/downloads/detail?name=wide-1.5.tar&can=2&q=)** and the instructions are in the **[wiki](http://code.google.com/p/wide/wiki/GettingStarted)**.
